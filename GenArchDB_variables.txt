gene	ensid	tissue	h2	h2_CI	pve	pve_CI	pge	pge_CI	en_R2


## gene = Gene name
## ensid = ensembl ID
## tissue = tissue (TS=tissue-specific, TW=tissue-wide)
## h2 = local h2 estimation (note tissues are across the columns in the GTEx h2 files)
## h2_CI = 95% confidence interval for h2, ideally formatted as [0.34-0.56], calculate as [h2-se, h2+se]
## pve = pve50 from BSLMM files
## pve_CI = 95% credible interval for pve, [pve025-pve975] from BSLMM files
## pge = pge50 from BSLMM files
## pge_CI = 95% credible interval for pge, [pge025-pge975] from BSLMM files
## en_R2 = R2 from the elasticNet_alpha0.5 files
